					<description><![CDATA[The new functions coming to construction for equipment telematics promise to make life easier for owners and equipment managers. Sure, they’re reducing waste and lowering costs, but the real transformation on the horizon is one where advanced streams of data combine to create entirely new ways managing machines.




There are some big shifts taking place in the field of construction equipment telematics. Starting with the integration of telematics devices in vehicles right from the manufacturers, to the standardization and integration of telematics data across various business functions, the future of telematics has never seemed so full of potential for fleet-based businesses.

The whole difference between construction and creation is exactly this: that a thing constructed can only be loved after it is constructed; but a thing created is loved before it exists.

Another speaker, John Meese, senior director of heavy equipment at Waste Management Inc., echoed this, citing a cost saving of $17,000 for the company when it cut idling time of a single Caterpillar 966 wheel loader.
